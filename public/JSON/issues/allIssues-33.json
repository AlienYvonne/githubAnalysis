Some further improvements could be made in number parsing by incorporating custom floating point parsing into the proposed `get_integer()` in lieu of `strtof()`/`strtod()`/`strtold()` but this would greatly increase code complexity and the improvements would likely be marginal at best.\n\nLooking at the other libraries results (especially the ones with fast parsing) it looks like allocations are what is killing us.  The other thing that might be killing us is the use of map.  This is not ideal for parsing a large unordered file because the tree will be continually re-balanced.  The benefit of using a map is lookup, but that isn't really tested in this benchmark as the timed access is all sequential.  \n\nNote that I'm not saying we should be moving away from map, because our library is really designed around using the json object to store data, not merely to parse/dump json files.  We probably just have to accept that our parse is always going to be slower.\n\n**Stringify**\nThe proposed change to `snprintf()` for floating point stringifying highlights just how bad `stringstream`s are for this.  There may be further improvements by reducing our reliance on `stringstream`s elsewhere but this would come at the expense of c++ style.  I did try using `snprintf()` for integers, and even a very efficient custom function I've used before on microcontrollers, but didn't achieve any significant improvement so perhaps the issue is only manifest for floating point numbers.\n\nThe other thing here is that use of map is probably not as fast for sequential dumping as other container types.  I think this is just a price we have to pay.\n\n**Time**\nThis test simply iterates through the document while collecting statistics about number of strings, numbers, objects, arrays etc.  Any difference between library versions is an anomaly as there are no significant differences (only the bitfield overhead for the proposed changes).  Because this test is sequential we are at a disadvantage using maps.\n\nThe bottom line seems to be that a choice must be made - do we optimize for rapid parsing/dumping/sequential access at the expense of lookup, or do we optimize for lookup and accept that parsing/dumping/sequential access will always be a little slower (but not that much).\n\n@nlohmann, if you are able to run similar tests under Linux/OSX that would help to make sure this isn't just a VS2015 issue.\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/201", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/201/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/201/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/201/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/201", "id": 129938375, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTc3MzAwNzY=", "number": 201, "title": "Fixed Issue #187 - Change parse to record floating point representation", "user": {"login": "twelsby", "id": 16697318, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2Njk3MzE4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16697318?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby", "html_url": "https://github.com/twelsby", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": {"login": "nlohmann", "id": 159488, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTQ4OA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/159488?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "nlohmann", "id": 159488, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTQ4OA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/159488?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/milestones/3", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/milestone/3", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/milestones/3/labels", "id": 1510937, "node_id": "MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTUxMDkzNw==", "number": 3, "title": "Release 2.0.0", "description": "This release adds several features such as JSON Pointers, JSON Patch, or support for 64 bit unsigned integers.

New function `get_integer()` that is used instead of `strtoull()`/`strtoll()`.  This function implements custom integer parsing that saves the number to the correct basic_json type and returns the type.  This also eliminates the need for `attempt_cast()` as overflow is detected internally.  Additionally details about the floating point representation are collected during the parse (in the event it is not an integer) such as the number of significant figures, the capitalization of 'e' and the use of the optional positive exponential sign.  For floating point numbers this function is faster then the method currently used in 2.0.0 and only slightly slower than the method used in 1.1.0.  For integers this method is significantly faster than both 2.0.0 and 1.1.0.\n2. New type `type_data_t` that incorporates the `value_t` enum into a bitfield with the floating point representation information.  This ensures that no additional memory is used in any packing scenario except byte level packing (unlikely and even then only a small amount extra is used).  The type includes operator overloads so that it can be used as an almost drop in replacement for the straight `value_t` (switch statements need to be changed to use the get() method).  Using bitfields results in a small performance overhead but as these variables are accessed only infrequently it is not significant.\n3. Modification to the dumping of floating point numbers, which now uses `snprintf()` for the conversion to enable application of the recorded floating point representation.  This results in massive performance improvements simply from the change to `snprintf()`.\n4. Addition of extra roundtrip unit tests that target the new behaviour.\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/200", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/200/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/200/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/200/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/200", "id": 129932055, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTc3Mjc4ODk=", "number": 200, "title": "Fixed issue #199 - Small bugs in json.hpp (get_number) and unit.cpp (non-standard integer type test)", "user": {"login": "twelsby", "id": 16697318, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2Njk3MzE4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16697318?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby", "html_url": "https://github.com/twelsby", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/milestones/3", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/milestone/3", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/milestones/3/labels", "id": 1510937, "node_id": "MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTUxMDkzNw==", "number": 3, "title": "Release 2.0.0", "description": "This release adds several features such as JSON Pointers, JSON Patch, or support for 64 bit unsigned integers.

This is required due to the bug in `strtod()` that is uncorrected in Precise builds of the standard library but fixed in Trusty.  This bug causes a single bit rounding error that may occur in as many as 1 in 4096 of the possible double values.\n\nNote that currently this PR still uses the `llvm-toolchain-precise*` repositories because the  `llvm-toolchain-trusty*` ones have not been added to the Travis white-list.  This works because clang is not the problem, rather it is the standard library. \n\nThere is an open issue on Travis [APT source whitelist request for llvm-toolchain-trusty #199](https://github.com/travis-ci/apt-source-whitelist/issues/199) to add the repositories to the white-list at which point `.travis.yml` can be further updated.  It is suggested that perhaps this pull be merged but issue #195 be left open until the trusty llvm repos can be added as well.\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/195", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/195/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/195/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/195/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/195", "id": 128533614, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUxMjg1MzM2MTQ=", "number": 195, "title": "GCC/clang floating point parsing bug in strtod()", "user": {"login": "twelsby", "id": 16697318, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2Njk3MzE4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16697318?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby", "html_url": "https://github.com/twelsby", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 46374231, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw0NjM3NDIzMQ==", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/labels/kind:%20bug", "name": "kind: bug", "color": "fc2929", "default": false}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/milestones/3", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/milestone/3", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/milestones/3/labels", "id": 1510937, "node_id": "MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTUxMDkzNw==", "number": 3, "title": "Release 2.0.0", "description": "This release adds several features such as JSON Pointers, JSON Patch, or support for 64 bit unsigned integers.

Local gcc/clang builds and AppVeyor builds all ran correctly.\n\nThis was mentioned in issue #186 where I speculated that it was likely caused by a bug in `strtod()` in what must have been an older version on Travis.  To address that issue and get the rest of the tests to run on Travis, pull #191 (now merged) disabled this test for gcc/clang.\n\nResearch identified the following blog post: [How strtod() Works (and Sometimes Doesn\u2019t)](http://www.exploringbinary.com/how-strtod-works-and-sometimes-doesnt/), which indicates that it was caused by the double rounding error that was suspected all along to have caused it.  Although the bug was fixed back in 2013, it appears that the bug is still present in both gcc and clang on the version of Ubuntu on which the Travis builds run (precise).\n\nTravis also has a more recent version of Ubuntu (trusty), which is currently in beta.  I decided see if upgrading `.travis.yml` to build on trusty instead might address the bug and allow the test to also be done under gcc/clang - it works.  The trusty environment is beta but there do not appear to be any issues with the build and it is inevitable that we will need to migrate to trusty eventually so it might as well be now.\n"}, {"url":

This prevents the double rounding that causes errors in particular cases where`number_float_t`is not a`long double` due to the cast that is then required.\n2. `parse_internal()` now tests for the special case of `-0.0` and ensures that such numbers are stored as a float as they cannot be accurately represented with integer types.\n3. `dump()` now tests for floating point numbers that do not have a fractional component (e.g. `1.0`, `42.0`, `-36.0`) and in this case uses a `std::fixed` and `std:setprecision(1)` representation.

While this worked for gcc it causes `operator<<` ambiguity under VS2015 for reasons that are still unclear (to me, but may be obvious to others).  It would be more satisfying to know why this caused VS2015 to break but not gcc but at least it solves the problem.  The fix for implicit conversion to strings still works after this change.\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/187", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/187/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/187/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/187/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/187", "id": 128223992, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUxMjgyMjM5OTI=", "number": 187, "title": "Bugs in miloyip/nativejson-benchmark: roundtrips", "user": {"login": "nlohmann", "id": 159488, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTQ4OA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/159488?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nlohmann/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 232252782, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMzIyNTI3ODI=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/labels/confirmed", "name": "confirmed", "color": "e11d21", "default": false}, {"id": 46374231, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw0NjM3NDIzMQ==", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/labels/kind:%20bug", "name": "kind: bug", "color": "fc2929", "default": false}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/milestones/3", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/milestone/3", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/milestones/3/labels", "id": 1510937, "node_id": "MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTUxMDkzNw==", "number": 3, "title": "Release 2.0.0", "description": "This release adds several features such as JSON Pointers, JSON Patch, or support for 64 bit unsigned integers.

If this function is intended as nothing more than a way to suppress gcc's compiler warning then it is achieving its objective and you can close this issue.  But if it is intended to avoid perceived pitfalls of `if(float == float)` type statements then it is not doing that.\n\nTry running this code:\n\n``` c++\n#include <random>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <float>\n\nint main()\n{\n    std::mt19937 eng;  // a core engine class \n    float halfrange = 100 * std::numeric_limits<float>::epsilon();\n    std::uniform_real_distribution<float> dist(1-halfrange, 1+halfrange);\n    int agree=0, disagree=0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000000; ++i) {\n        float a = dist(eng);\n        float b = dist(eng);\n        bool method_1 = not (a > b or a < b);\n        bool method_2 = (a == b);\n        if (method_1 or method_2) {\n            if (method_1 == method_2) agree++;\n            else disagree++;\n            std::cout << \"\\rIteration: \" << i << \" Agree: \" << agree << \" Disagree: \" << disagree;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBasically this generates pairs of floating point numbers in a very small range about 1 and then compares them for equality using both the `==` method and the one in `approx`.  The small range is to ensure collisions occur frequently.  If either method says they are equal then it increments one of two counters depending on whether they both agree or disagree with the equality.  Let it run as long as you like - you will never see disagreement.\n\nThe only way I know of to achieve what it is trying to achieve is to determine the difference between the two floats and see if it is less than some arbitrary acceptable error (usually based on epsilon).\n\nBut I don't actually think we should be doing that.\n\nThe concern about `if(float == float)` seems to be based around the idea that floating point numbers are somehow indeterminate or uncertain but this is not true - they are fundamentally as determinate as integers - provided the storage and rounding rules are consistent, and that is what IEEE is all about.  If I assign a particular floating point number to a variable then the resulting floating point representation should be the same as long as the storage and rounding rules are the same.  If I move it to another memory location it will stay the same and I can compare it with the original for equality and it will be equal (assuming the type doesn't change during this process).  The x87 instruction set even includes instructions for testing equality.\n\nThe alleged inaccuracies in floating point numbers arise from, in my opinion, a misunderstanding about how they are stored due to the assumption that terminating floating point decimal numbers will also be terminating floating point binary numbers.  The most oft-quoted example is 0.1<sub>10</sub>, which in binary is the non-terminating 0.0001100110011...<sub>2</sub>.\n\nIf you were under the mistaken belief that 0.1<sub>10</sub> can be represented in a terminating binary floating point number then you would expect that adding it to 0.8<sub>10</sub> would produce 0.9<sub>10</sub> and that if you assigned 0.9<sub>10</sub> to another variable and compared them that they would be equal.  This is not the case because all three numbers incur rounding.\n\nApply the same logic to non-terminating decimal numbers and the problem becomes obvious.  One non-terminating decimal number is 1/3, which can be approximated as 0.33 (with as many digits as you like).  Most people would be aware that 3 \\* 1/3 = 1 but would also not be surprised that 3 \\* 0.33 does not equal 1 (no matter how many digits you use), because of the rounding.  Do the same in binary and the result seems indeterminate.\n\nThis is what is \"unsafe\" about floating point equality and if this scenario would cause problems then that is when you would apply the method I mentioned.\n\nNow none of this should concern us because nowhere are we doing actual floating point calculations.  We just take floating point numbers store them, retrieve them and compare them etc.  Even the cast with approx comparison (for the loss of precision check) doesn't do anything that would trip up.\n\nReally it should be up the the user of the library to take into account rounding because they know how precisely their data is defined, and how close they want their numbers to be before they are considered equal, and the rounding settings they have applied.  Users should be able to expect that if `operator==` says two floating point numbers are equal that they are equal, not merely close.  It is their responsibility, if storing a literal or the result of a calculation they have done, to take into account the rounding that may have occurred, the same as if they were using regular variables.\n\nThe warnings that would result can be suppressed with a `#pragma`.\n"}]
