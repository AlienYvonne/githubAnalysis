merged yet; there are still a couple things on my to do list. However, I was hoping to open a discussion about the design of this and what you think before completely finishing it out. I'm hoping it's like 70% there. Inspired by #229, #457, maybe others, and of course my own needs/wants. (Almost everything in here is something that is useful to me.) I'm not sure how you want to work; I'm open to instructions otherwise, and I also fully expect to iterate on this at least a couple times.\r\n\r\nLet me emphasize that I am primarily focused on feedback on the design, with an eye toward whether you want this in your library. I think the [tests](https://github.com/EvanED/json/blob/fancy-serialization/test/src/unit-fancy-serialization.cpp) and [documentation](https://github.com/EvanED/json/blob/fancy-serialization/doc/StyledPrettyPrinting.md) are likely to be the most useful for that, but I don't know how you work. If everything looks great then feel free to take a look at the implementation, but at least for me, that wouldn't be my first stop.\r\n\r\nThere are a few conceptual groups of changes. I can break these into separate pull requests if you like. I don't know how related or unrelated they should be before they become a \"separate issue.\" Here are changes I made to the stock code, not counting my additions:\r\n\r\n* At least for me, when I ran `make pretty` on a clean `develop` checkout, I got changes. (`Artistic Style Version 2.05.1`) So there's one commit cleaning that up. Several files have those changes.\r\n* During this, I discovered an extreme edge case bug -- if the indent width ever grew to >512, it would ignore the provided indent character. (1c1c78908424)\r\n* I added accessors into `json_pointer` -- though I'm not thrilled with it. See my documentation document for more thoughts on that. (Those are the `json_pointer.hpp` and `unit-json-pointer.cpp`)\r\n* I split off everything for rendering strings and numbers from `serializer` to a new `primitve_serializer`. This change also spawned the `unit-convenience.cpp` and `unit-coversion.cpp` changes. (It became a little more obnoxious to test internals, but I'm thinking this doesn't matter.)\r\n\r\nThen there are my additions:\r\n* `fancy_serializer.hpp` holds the actual code\r\n* `unit-fancy-serialization.cpp` has the tests (I guess now that I'm writing this I'm not sure if I have 100% coverage, but I'd think I'm at least close if not there -- this is a design RFC anyway)\r\n* `json.hpp` has a couple trivial changes to make my thing a friend\r\n* `StyledPrettyPrinting.md` has documentation of the new capabilities. :exclamation: indicates a couple things I have TODO, and :question:  calls out items I specifically think feedback would be valuable on. If you're a top-down person, this is probably where to start for my additions.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n## Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nRead the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed information.\r\n\r\n- [x]  Changes are described in the pull request, or an [existing issue is referenced](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues).\r\n- [x]  The test suite [compiles and runs](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/README.md#execute-unit-tests) without error. *Tested with GCC 5, Ubuntu 16, with and without ASan*\r\n- [ ]  [Code coverage](https://coveralls.io/github/nlohmann/json) is 100%. Test cases can be added by editing the [test suite](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/tree/develop/test/src). *How do I get coverage metrics?*\r\n- [x]  The source code is amalgamated; that is, after making changes to the sources in the `include/nlohmann` directory, run `make amalgamate` to create the single-header file `single_include/nlohmann/json.hpp`. The whole process is described [here](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#files-to-change).\r\n\r\n## Please don't\r\n\r\n- The C++11 support varies between different **compilers** and versions. Please note the [list of supported compilers](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/README.md#supported-compilers). Some compilers like GCC 4.8 (and earlier), Clang 3.3 (and earlier), or Microsoft Visual Studio 13.0 and earlier are known not to work due to missing or incomplete C++11 support. Please refrain from proposing changes that work around these compiler's limitations with `#ifdef`s or other means.\r\n- Specifically, I am aware of compilation problems with **Microsoft Visual Studio** (there even is an [issue label](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues?utf8=\u2713&q=label%3A%22visual+studio%22+) for these kind of bugs). I understand that even in 2016, complete C++11 support isn't there yet. But please also understand that I do not want to drop features or uglify the code just to make Microsoft's sub-standard compiler happy. The past has shown that there are ways to express the functionality such that the code compiles with the most recent MSVC - unfortunately, this is not the main objective of the project.\r\n- Please refrain from proposing changes that would **break [JSON](http://json.org) conformance**. If you propose a conformant extension of JSON to be supported by the library, please motivate this extension.\r\n- Please do not open pull requests that address **multiple issues**.\r\n"}, {"url":
