[`src/json.hpp.re2c`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/src/json.hpp.re2c) (note the `.re2c` suffix) - This file contains a comment section which describes the JSON lexic. This section is translated by [`re2c`](http://re2c.org) into file [`src/json.hpp`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/src/json.hpp) which is plain \"vanilla\" C++11 code. (In fact, the generated lexer consists of some hundred lines of `goto`s, which is a hint you never want to edit this file...).\r\n\r\n   If you only edit file `src/json.hpp` (without the `.re2c` suffix), your changes will be overwritten as soon as the lexer is touched again. To generate the `src/json.hpp` file which is actually used during compilation of the tests and all other code, please execute\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   make re2c\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   To run [`re2c`](http://re2c.org) and generate/overwrite file `src/json.hpp` with your changes in file `src/json.hpp.re2c`.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. [`test/src/unit.cpp`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/test/unit.cpp) - This contains the [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) unit tests which currently cover [100 %](https://coveralls.io/github/nlohmann/json) of the library's code.\r\n\r\n   If you add or change a feature, please also add a unit test to this file. The unit tests can be compiled with\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   make\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   and can be executed with\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   ./json_unit\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   The test cases are also executed with several different compilers on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/nlohmann/json) once you open a pull request.\r\n\r\nPlease understand that I cannot accept pull requests changing only file `src/json.hpp`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n\r\n- If you open a pull request, the code will be automatically tested with [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org)'s Memcheck tool to detect memory leaks. Please be aware that the execution with Valgrind _may_ in rare cases yield different behavior than running the code directly. This can result in failing unit tests which run successfully without Valgrind.\r\n\r\n## Please don't\r\n\r\n- Only make changes to file `src/json.hpp` -- please read the paragraph above and understand why `src/json.hpp.re2c` exists.\r\n- The C++11 support varies between different **compilers** and versions. Please note the [list of supported compilers](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/README.md#supported-compilers). Some compilers like GCC 4.8 (and earlier), Clang 3.3 (and earlier), or Microsoft Visual Studio 13.0 and earlier are known not to work due to missing or incomplete C++11 support. Please refrain from proposing changes that work around these compiler's limitations with `#ifdef`s or other means.\r\n- Specifically, I am aware of compilation problems with **Microsoft Visual Studio** (there even is an [issue label](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues?utf8=\u2713&q=label%3A%22visual+studio%22+) for these kind of bugs). I understand that even in 2016, complete C++11 support isn't there yet. But please also understand that I do not want to drop features or uglify the code just to make Microsoft's sub-standard compiler happy. The past has shown that there are ways to express the functionality such that the code compiles with the most recent MSVC - unfortunately, this is not the main objective of the project.\r\n- Please refrain from proposing changes that would **break [JSON](http://json.org) conformance**. If you propose a conformant extension of JSON to be supported by the library, please motivate this extension.\r\n- Please do not open pull requests that address **multiple issues**.\r\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/439", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/439/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/439/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/439/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/439", "id": 203846675, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTAzNjMzMTE5", "number": 439, "title": "README: adjust boost::optional example", "user": {"login": "jaredgrubb", "id": 1256381, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTYzODE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1256381?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaredgrubb", "html_url": "https://github.com/jaredgrubb", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaredgrubb/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaredgrubb/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaredgrubb/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaredgrubb/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaredgrubb/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaredgrubb/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaredgrubb/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaredgrubb/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaredgrubb/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 395133926, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwzOTUxMzM5MjY=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/labels/documentation", "name": "documentation", "color": "0e8a16", "default": false}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2017-01-29T02:47:53Z", "updated_at": "2017-01-29T07:18:49Z", "closed_at": "2017-01-29T07:18:45Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/pulls/439", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/439", "diff_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/439.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/439.patch"}, "body": "The \"from_json\" example for boost::optional is not complete and should also handle the 'none' case.

currently two files which need to be edited:\r\n\r\n1. [`src/json.hpp.re2c`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/src/json.hpp.re2c) (note the `.re2c` suffix) - This file contains a comment section which describes the JSON lexic. This section is translated by [`re2c`](http://re2c.org) into file [`src/json.hpp`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/src/json.hpp) which is plain \"vanilla\" C++11 code. (In fact, the generated lexer consists of some hundred lines of `goto`s, which is a hint you never want to edit this file...).\r\n\r\n   If you only edit file `src/json.hpp` (without the `.re2c` suffix), your changes will be overwritten as soon as the lexer is touched again. To generate the `src/json.hpp` file which is actually used during compilation of the tests and all other code, please execute\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   make re2c\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   To run [`re2c`](http://re2c.org) and generate/overwrite file `src/json.hpp` with your changes in file `src/json.hpp.re2c`.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. [`test/src/unit.cpp`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/test/unit.cpp) - This contains the [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) unit tests which currently cover [100 %](https://coveralls.io/github/nlohmann/json) of the library's code.\r\n\r\n   If you add or change a feature, please also add a unit test to this file. The unit tests can be compiled with\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   make\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   and can be executed with\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   ./json_unit\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   The test cases are also executed with several different compilers on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/nlohmann/json) once you open a pull request.\r\n\r\nPlease understand that I cannot accept pull requests changing only file `src/json.hpp`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n\r\n- If you open a pull request, the code will be automatically tested with [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org)'s Memcheck tool to detect memory leaks. Please be aware that the execution with Valgrind _may_ in rare cases yield different behavior than running the code directly. This can result in failing unit tests which run successfully without Valgrind.\r\n\r\n## Please don't\r\n\r\n- Only make changes to file `src/json.hpp` -- please read the paragraph above and understand why `src/json.hpp.re2c` exists.\r\n- The C++11 support varies between different **compilers** and versions. Please note the [list of supported compilers](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/README.md#supported-compilers). Some compilers like GCC 4.8 (and earlier), Clang 3.3 (and earlier), or Microsoft Visual Studio 13.0 and earlier are known not to work due to missing or incomplete C++11 support. Please refrain from proposing changes that work around these compiler's limitations with `#ifdef`s or other means.\r\n- Specifically, I am aware of compilation problems with **Microsoft Visual Studio** (there even is an [issue label](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues?utf8=\u2713&q=label%3A%22visual+studio%22+) for these kind of bugs). I understand that even in 2016, complete C++11 support isn't there yet. But please also understand that I do not want to drop features or uglify the code just to make Microsoft's sub-standard compiler happy. The past has shown that there are ways to express the functionality such that the code compiles with the most recent MSVC - unfortunately, this is not the main objective of the project.\r\n- Please refrain from proposing changes that would **break [JSON](http://json.org) conformance**. If you propose a conformant extension of JSON to be supported by the library, please motivate this extension.\r\n- Please do not open pull requests that address **multiple issues**.\r\n"}]
