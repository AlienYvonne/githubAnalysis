[`src/json.hpp.re2c`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/src/json.hpp.re2c) (note the `.re2c` suffix) - This file contains a comment section which describes the JSON lexic. This section is translated by [`re2c`](http://re2c.org) into file [`src/json.hpp`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/src/json.hpp) which is plain \"vanilla\" C++11 code. (In fact, the generated lexer consists of some hundred lines of `goto`s, which is a hint you never want to edit this file...).\n   \n   If you only edit file `src/json.hpp` (without the `.re2c` suffix), your changes will be overwritten as soon as the lexer is touched again. To generate the `src/json.hpp` file which is actually used during compilation of the tests and all other code, please execute\n   \n   ``` sh\n   make re2c\n   ```\n   \n   To run [`re2c`](http://re2c.org) and generate/overwrite file `src/json.hpp` with your changes in file `src/json.hpp.re2c`.\n2. [`test/src/unit.cpp`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/test/unit.cpp) - This contains the [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) unit tests which currently cover [100 %](https://coveralls.io/github/nlohmann/json) of the library's code.\n   \n   If you add or change a feature, please also add a unit test to this file. The unit tests can be compiled with\n   \n   ``` sh\n   make\n   ```\n   \n   and can be executed with\n   \n   ``` sh\n   ./json_unit\n   ```\n   \n   The test cases are also executed with several different compilers on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/nlohmann/json) once you open a pull request.\n\nPlease understand that I cannot accept pull requests changing only file `src/json.hpp`.\n## Note\n- If you open a pull request, the code will be automatically tested with [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org)'s Memcheck tool to detect memory leaks. Please be aware that the execution with Valgrind _may_ in rare cases yield different behavior than running the code directly. This can result in failing unit tests which run successfully without Valgrind.\n## Please don't\n- Only make changes to file `src/json.hpp` -- please read the paragraph above and understand why `src/json.hpp.re2c` exists.\n- The C++11 support varies between different **compilers** and versions. Please note the [list of supported compilers](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/README.md#supported-compilers). Some compilers like GCC 4.8 (and earlier), Clang 3.3 (and earlier), or Microsoft Visual Studio 13.0 and earlier are known not to work due to missing or incomplete C++11 support. Please refrain from proposing changes that work around these compiler's limitations with `#ifdef`s or other means.\n- Specifically, I am aware of compilation problems with **Microsoft Visual Studio** (there even is an [issue label](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues?utf8=\u2713&q=label%3A%22visual+studio%22+) for these kind of bugs). I understand that even in 2016, complete C++11 support isn't there yet. But please also understand that I do not want to drop features or uglify the code just to make Microsoft's sub-standard compiler happy. The past has shown that there are ways to express the functionality such that the code compiles with the most recent MSVC - unfortunately, this is not the main objective of the project.\n- Please refrain from proposing changes that would **break [JSON](http://json.org) conformance**. If you propose a conformant extension of JSON to be supported by the library, please motivate this extension.\n- Please do not open pull requests that address **multiple issues**.\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/247", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/247/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/247/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/247/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/247", "id": 155472982, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzA1MDc0NDk=", "number": 247, "title": "Define CMake/CTest tests", "user": {"login": "robertmrk", "id": 7045469, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDU0Njk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7045469?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/robertmrk", "html_url": "https://github.com/robertmrk", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robertmrk/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robertmrk/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robertmrk/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robertmrk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robertmrk/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robertmrk/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robertmrk/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robertmrk/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robertmrk/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/milestones/3", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/milestone/3", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/milestones/3/labels", "id": 1510937, "node_id": "MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTUxMDkzNw==", "number": 3, "title": "Release 2.0.0", "description": "This release adds several features such as JSON Pointers, JSON Patch, or support for 64 bit unsigned integers.

It's great that he noticed this and provided a fix for it, I totally missed this issue when I rewrote the CMake lists file.\nIn #242 the issue is fixed by installing the test executable and test files. There are two problems with this approach:\n1. The test executable is used only once by the users of the library. It's executed only after a successful build and never used again, so there is no need to install it on the system level.\n2. For executing the tests in out of source builds we don't need to copy any files at all. In CMake we can define tests with the source directory as their working directory, so tests will be able to find the JSON files no matter where the project is built.\n\nIn this PR I defined two CMake/CTest test configurations. \n- `json_unit_default` for running the default tests by executing\n  `json_unit` without any arguments\n- `json_unit_all` for running all the tests by executing `json_unit`\n  with the `\"*\"` argument\n\nSo the tests can be now executed by building the `test` target:\n\n```\nmake test\n```\n\nor by running `ctest` in the build directory.\n\nThe tests can be selectively executed as well with `ctest`:\n\n```\nctest -R json_unit_default\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nctest -R json_unit_all\n```\n"}]
