[`src/json.hpp.re2c`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/src/json.hpp.re2c) (note the `.re2c` suffix) - This file contains a comment section which describes the JSON lexic. This section is translated by [`re2c`](http://re2c.org) into file [`src/json.hpp`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/src/json.hpp) which is plain \"vanilla\" C++11 code. (In fact, the generated lexer consists of some hundred lines of `goto`s, which is a hint you never want to edit this file...).\n   \n   If you only edit file `src/json.hpp` (without the `.re2c` suffix), your changes will be overwritten as soon as the lexer is touched again. To generate the `src/json.hpp` file which is actually used during compilation of the tests and all other code, please execute\n   \n   ``` sh\n   make re2c\n   ```\n   \n   To run [`re2c`](http://re2c.org) and generate/overwrite file `src/json.hpp` with your changes in file `src/json.hpp.re2c`.\n2. [`test/unit.cpp`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/test/unit.cpp) - This contains the [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) unit tests which currently cover [100 %](https://coveralls.io/github/nlohmann/json) of the library's code.\n   \n   If you add or change a feature, please also add a unit test to this file. The unit tests can be compiled with\n   \n   ``` sh\n   make\n   ```\n   \n   and can be executed with\n   \n   ``` sh\n   ./json_unit\n   ```\n   \n   The test cases are also executed with several different compilers on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/nlohmann/json) once you open a pull request.\n\nPlease understand that I cannot accept pull requests changing only file `src/json.hpp`.\n## Note\n- If you open a pull request, the code will be automatically tested with [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org)'s Memcheck tool to detect memory leaks. Please be aware that the execution with Valgrind _may_ in rare cases yield different behavior than running the code directly. This can result in failing unit tests which run successfully without Valgrind.\n## Please don't\n- Only make changes to file `src/json.hpp` -- please read the paragraph above and understand why `src/json.hpp.re2c` exists.\n- The C++11 support varies between different **compilers** and versions. Please note the [list of supported compilers](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/README.md#supported-compilers). Some compilers like GCC 4.8 (and earlier), Clang 3.3 (and earlier), or Microsoft Visual Studio 13.0 and earlier are known not to work due to missing or incomplete C++11 support. Please refrain from proposing changes that work around these compiler's limitations with `#ifdef`s or other means.\n- Specifically, I am aware of compilation problems with **Microsoft Visual Studio** (there even is an [issue label](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues?utf8=\u2713&q=label%3A%22visual+studio%22+) for these kind of bugs). I understand that even in 2016, complete C++11 support isn't there yet. But please also understand that I do not want to drop features or uglify the code just to make Microsoft's sub-standard compiler happy. The past has shown that there are ways to express the functionality such that the code compiles with the most recent MSVC - unfortunately, this is not the main objective of the project.\n- Please refrain from proposing changes that would **break [JSON](http://json.org) conformance**. If you propose a conformant extension of JSON to be supported by the library, please motivate this extension.\n- Please do not open pull requests that address **multiple issues**.\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/238", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/238/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/238/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/238/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/238", "id": 150842702, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Njc3MTE0NjE=", "number": 238, "title": "Implement additional integration options", "user": {"login": "robertmrk", "id": 7045469, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDU0Njk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7045469?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/robertmrk", "html_url": "https://github.com/robertmrk", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robertmrk/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robertmrk/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robertmrk/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robertmrk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robertmrk/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robertmrk/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robertmrk/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robertmrk/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robertmrk/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2016-04-25T12:31:56Z", "updated_at": "2016-04-26T18:31:55Z", "closed_at": "2016-04-26T18:31:19Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/pulls/238", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/238", "diff_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/238.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/238.patch"}, "body": "This PR contains the implementation of the changes suggested in #237.\nThe listfile is quite different then it was.
