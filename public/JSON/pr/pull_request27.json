New function `get_integer()` that is used instead of `strtoull()`/`strtoll()`.  This function implements custom integer parsing that saves the number to the correct basic_json type and returns the type.  This also eliminates the need for `attempt_cast()` as overflow is detected internally.  Additionally details about the floating point representation are collected during the parse (in the event it is not an integer) such as the number of significant figures, the capitalization of 'e' and the use of the optional positive exponential sign.  For floating point numbers this function is faster then the method currently used in 2.0.0 and only slightly slower than the method used in 1.1.0.  For integers this method is significantly faster than both 2.0.0 and 1.1.0.\n2. New type `type_data_t` that incorporates the `value_t` enum into a bitfield with the floating point representation information.  This ensures that no additional memory is used in any packing scenario except byte level packing (unlikely and even then only a small amount extra is used).  The type includes operator overloads so that it can be used as an almost drop in replacement for the straight `value_t` (switch statements need to be changed to use the get() method).  Using bitfields results in a small performance overhead but as these variables are accessed only infrequently it is not significant.\n3. Modification to the dumping of floating point numbers, which now uses `snprintf()` for the conversion to enable application of the recorded floating point representation.  This results in massive performance improvements simply from the change to `snprintf()`.\n4. Addition of extra roundtrip unit tests that target the new behaviour.\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/200", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/200/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/200/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/200/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/200", "id": 129932055, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTc3Mjc4ODk=", "number": 200, "title": "Fixed issue #199 - Small bugs in json.hpp (get_number) and unit.cpp (non-standard integer type test)", "user": {"login": "twelsby", "id": 16697318, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2Njk3MzE4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16697318?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby", "html_url": "https://github.com/twelsby", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twelsby/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/milestones/3", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/milestone/3", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/milestones/3/labels", "id": 1510937, "node_id": "MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTUxMDkzNw==", "number": 3, "title": "Release 2.0.0", "description": "This release adds several features such as JSON Pointers, JSON Patch, or support for 64 bit unsigned integers.

This works because clang is not the problem, rather it is the standard library. \n\nThere is an open issue on Travis [APT source whitelist request for llvm-toolchain-trusty #199](https://github.com/travis-ci/apt-source-whitelist/issues/199) to add the repositories to the white-list at which point `.travis.yml` can be further updated.

While this worked for gcc it causes `operator<<` ambiguity under VS2015 for reasons that are still unclear (to me, but may be obvious to others).  It would be more satisfying to know why this caused VS2015 to break but not gcc but at least it solves the problem.  The fix for implicit conversion to strings still works after this change.\n"}]
