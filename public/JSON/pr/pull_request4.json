Unfortunately, that does also come with some disadvantages, namely the compile times are often higher with such code dependencies.\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces a 'json_forward.hpp' header file (similar to how Boost offer forward header files) in an attempt to try reduce build times.  \r\n\r\nThings to note (and some of these come down to personal preference):\r\n- json.hpp includes json_forward.hpp to minimise code replication\r\n- json.hpp includes some of same std library headers as json_forward.hpp (technically these could be removed) but with #include guards, I don't feel this is much of an issue. Discuss.\r\n\r\nPoints to consider:\r\n- Code change is small.\r\n- It reduces build times (at least what I've seen).\r\n\r\nSo I tried integrating these code changes with my own project and ran a comparison test.\r\n\r\nBuild time without forward declaration header:\r\n> real\t10m7.981s\r\n> user\t36m40.768s\r\n> sys\t2m1.432s\r\n\r\n\r\nBuild time making extensive use of forward declaration header (where possible):\r\n> real\t9m21.282s\r\n> user\t33m53.744s\r\n> sys\t1m52.880s\r\n\r\nPlease note that this test was _not_ wholly scientific. I imagine mileage will vary across environments/compilers and the level of use of this library in the said project.\r\n\r\n\r\nTested with cmake and gcc 6.3 running on Ubuntu's 17.04 (Zesty).\r\n\r\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/822", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/822/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/822/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/822/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/822", "id": 271546003, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTUwOTA0NTM2", "number": 822, "title": "Fix Compile warning in Visual Studio", "user": {"login": "AraHaan", "id": 15173749, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTczNzQ5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15173749?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/AraHaan", "html_url": "https://github.com/AraHaan", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AraHaan/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AraHaan/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AraHaan/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AraHaan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AraHaan/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AraHaan/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AraHaan/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AraHaan/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AraHaan/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2017-11-06T16:55:28Z", "updated_at": "2017-11-07T01:21:01Z", "closed_at": "2017-11-06T20:58:24Z", "author_association": "NONE", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/pulls/822", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/822", "diff_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/822.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/822.patch"}, "body": "In issue #821 I found that on the latest (since version 2.0.7) there are now min and max warnings.

Test cases can be added by editing the [test suite](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/tree/develop/test/src).\r\n\r\n## Please don't\r\n\r\n- The C++11 support varies between different **compilers** and versions. Please note the [list of supported compilers](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/README.md#supported-compilers). Some compilers like GCC 4.8 (and earlier), Clang 3.3 (and earlier), or Microsoft Visual Studio 13.0 and earlier are known not to work due to missing or incomplete C++11 support. Please refrain from proposing changes that work around these compiler's limitations with `#ifdef`s or other means.\r\n- Specifically, I am aware of compilation problems with **Microsoft Visual Studio** (there even is an [issue label](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues?utf8=\u2713&q=label%3A%22visual+studio%22+) for these kind of bugs). I understand that even in 2016, complete C++11 support isn't there yet. But please also understand that I do not want to drop features or uglify the code just to make Microsoft's sub-standard compiler happy. The past has shown that there are ways to express the functionality such that the code compiles with the most recent MSVC - unfortunately, this is not the main objective of the project.\r\n- Please refrain from proposing changes that would **break [JSON](http://json.org) conformance**. If you propose a conformant extension of JSON to be supported by the library, please motivate this extension.\r\n- Please do not open pull requests that address **multiple issues**.\r\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/819", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/819/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/819/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/issues/819/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/819", "id": 271308523, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTUwNzM5MDQ3", "number": 819, "title": "Adds get_to", "user": {"login": "arcanis", "id": 1037931, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzc5MzE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1037931?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/arcanis", "html_url": "https://github.com/arcanis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 304694104, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwzMDQ2OTQxMDQ=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/labels/state:%20please%20discuss", "name": "state: please discuss", "color": "fbca04", "default": false}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 17, "created_at": "2017-11-05T19:54:20Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-09T01:24:10Z", "closed_at": "2018-01-09T01:24:10Z", "author_association": "NONE", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nlohmann/json/pulls/819", "html_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/819", "diff_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/819.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/819.patch"}, "body": "This PR adds a `get_to` method that does exactly the same thing as `get`, except that it doesn't create a new value to store the final result (it takes a reference instead).\r\n\r\nIt's a convenience function that can be easily implemented in userland (which is also true for `get`), but I felt like it was simple and useful enough to be added into the core.\r\n\r\nA few things have to be fixed before this PR can be merged, I plan to work on them if this API is accepted:\r\n\r\n  - [ ] Fixes the documentation\r\n  - [ ] Adds tests\r\n"}]
