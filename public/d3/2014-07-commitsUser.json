XDomainRequest only supports\nrequest.responseText, not request.response, but XMLHttpRequest throws an\nerror if request.responseText is read for non-text response types.\n\nA status code of 0 can mean either a local file was accessed, or there\nwas an error.  The response is checked to see if the error flag was set:\n\n* In the case of request.responseType being \"text\" or \"\",\n  request.responseText should be \"\".  Unfortunately it\u2019s impossible to\n  distinguish between an empty local text file and an error state, but\n  wanting to load empty local files seems rare.\n  XDomainRequest doesn\u2019t have a responseType and it only has\n  responseText, so we handle it here too.\n\n* For other response types, request.response should be null.  At the\n  moment, Safari 7.0.5 doesn\u2019t respect this, e.g. the response will be a\n  zero-length blob for the \"blob\" response type if the local file wasn\u2019t\n  found, but this seems to be fixed as of WebKit r171650.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/f7d39bac48663a9dc110d29c815aea59195a38a9"}], "mbostock@gmail.com": [{"date": "2014-07-17T22:58:17Z", "message": "Merge branch 'fix-transverse-mercator-center'", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/48ad44fdeef32b518c6271bb99a9aed376c1a1d6"}, {"date": "2014-07-17T05:25:23Z", "message": "Minor optimization.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/f5c380b8fb126c4ba04323496efabbee1d4a5271"}, {"date": "2014-06-19T19:04:05Z", "message": "Fix reported center.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/a394493007b8e13ec168cf34528ffca3bf521900"}, {"date": "2014-07-12T06:01:16Z", "message": "Merge branch '3.4.10'", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/a30a79ae0a8b9ce9a677fa0beda0e03eca1d94fa"}, {"date": "2014-07-12T06:00:28Z", "message": "Merge branch 'expose-global' of github.com:tbranyen/d3 into 3.4.10", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/0622785b00eb77aa1c0b8cdf46f651a348fe5084"}, {"date": "2014-07-12T05:56:49Z", "message": "Merge branch 'fix-zoom-implicit-center' into 3.4.10", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/e2bc377edbd15e9181d7c51f6adbce697fe2bbf2"}, {"date": "2014-07-12T05:56:12Z", "message": "Fix es-ES locale.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/64f0156a7a19f70f66fcec4122373f033641c843"}, {"date": "2014-07-12T04:48:40Z", "message": "Merge pull request #1928 from peperomeu/spanish-locale\n\nAdded locale for spanish", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/4f1a5b24fb80bbc32129e081da9e7316248b91fd"}, {"date": "2014-07-07T04:36:25Z", "message": "Fix #1933 - set zoom center on zoomstart.\n\nRather than set the zoom center on the first mousewheel following a mousemove,\nwe now set the zoom center on the first mousewheel event of a zoom gesture.
