The mousewheel gesture is\ndeemed to be finished if 50ms passes with no mousewheel event.\n\nAlthough the \"zoomend\" event is only dispatched when *both* gestures\nhave finished, the variable \"center0\" was being reset when *either*\ngesture was finished, causing an error in the mousewheel handler.\n\nFixes #2205.", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/7ce88c1f522f889f061acb637b9ff45fbaa452fb/comments", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/7ce88c1f522f889f061acb637b9ff45fbaa452fb"}]
