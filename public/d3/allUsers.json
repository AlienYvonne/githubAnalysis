Transitions now also support a `tween`\noperator, which is a generic mechanism for doing things during a transition; use\nthis in place of a \"tick\" event.\n\nThis commit also fixes a few bugs.

This commit also\nmakes it much easier to sequence transitions.\n\nPreviously, a transition's tweens were stored privately by the transition and\ncould only be accessed through the transition. This made it impossible to modify\ntransitions created by components: the transition is not accessible externally,\nand cannot be reselected from the document. Consider the following snippet:\n\n  g.select(\".x.axis\")\n      .call(xAxis)\n    .selectAll(\"text\")\n      .attr(\"dy\", null);\n\nIf `g` is a selection, then this code alters the appearance of the axis as\nexpected. However, if `g` is a transition, then transition.selectAll creates a\nnew concurrent transition, and now multiple tweens compete to set the \"dy\"\nattribute. Oy!\n\nUnder the new design, an element's scheduled tweens are stored semi-privately on\nthe node (in the existing node.__transition__). Transition parameters can thus\nbe reselected and modified by transitions that share the same id. If you now\nreselect a transitioning element, you modify the transition rather creating a\ncompeting transition; this should be less surprising and allow greater control.\n\nAs a side-effect of this change, it is no longer possible to schedule concurrent\ntransitions on the same element, even with the same id: only one transition may\nbe active on a given element at any time. (Note that you can still schedule\nmultiple future transitions on the same element, and concurrent transitions on\ndifferent elements.) For example, you could previously schedule overlapping\ntransitions with different easing functions, delays or durations, provided you\nwere careful to avoid conflict. This seems like a relatively obscure use-case\ncompared to modifying a transition, so I believe this is a reasonable change.\n\nThis commit also changes transition.transition, such that the returned\ntransition starts at the end of the originating transition, rather than\noverlapping. This makes it much easier to schedule sequenced transitions without\nthe complexity of transition.each(\"end\") and d3.select(this).\n\nAlso, transitions are now simply arrays of nodes, consistent with selections!"}, {"date": "2012-10-05T06:20:56Z", "message": "Merge pull request #839 from jasondavies/projection\n\nBetter resampling for non-linear distortions."}, {"date": "2012-10-04T17:14:16Z", "message": "Merge branch '2.10.3'"}, {"date": "2012-10-04T17:11:24Z", "message": "Avoid linear scan when adding new timer.\n\nTimer callbacks are now assigned a unique id, such that if an existing callback\nis later replaced, the timing parameters can be updated using a constant-time\nlookup rather than a linear scan of the timer queue."}, {"date": "2012-10-03T21:53:26Z", "message": "Merge pull request #837 from jasondavies/projection\n\nAdd extra ring if polygon \"surrounds\" clip circle."}, {"date": "2012-10-02T13:28:19Z", "message": "Revert \"Use linear interpolation for longitude.\"\n\nThis reverts commit b6d7c5e49e72e638462fecf1c33eee44f31700e7."}, {"date": "2012-10-02T13:19:31Z", "message": "Use linear interpolation for longitude."}, {"date": "2012-10-02T05:45:14Z", "message": "Fix for clipping losing `this`."}, {"date": "2012-10-02T05:39:17Z", "message": "Fix for some redundant points on resampling.\n\nAlso restore path.area and add a few tests."}, {"date": "2012-10-02T04:58:19Z", "message": "Rename for clarity."}, {"date": "2012-10-02T04:50:18Z", "message": "Refactor d3_geo_type."}, {"date": "2012-10-02T03:39:38Z", "message": "Add tests for d3.geo.bounds."}, {"date": "2012-10-02T01:20:14Z", "message": "Enforce built-in precision for outline, too."}, {"date": "2012-11-30T18:25:12Z", "message": "CORS support for IE9 via XDomainRequest.\n\nFixes #776."}, {"date": "2012-11-26T23:47:06Z", "message": "Snap to powers of two for zoom dblclick."}, {"date": "2012-11-18T18:21:55Z", "message": "Merge branch 'geo' of https://github.com/jasondavies/d3 into 3.0"}, {"date": "2012-11-18T18:16:01Z", "message": "Delete d3.geo.circle clip test."}, {"date": "2012-11-18T18:15:13Z", "message": "Fix accidental global context."}, {"date": "2012-11-18T18:12:41Z", "message": "Remove defunct d3.geo.circle clip.\n\nThis has been replaced by d3.geo.projection clipAngle."}, {"date": "2012-11-18T17:12:10Z", "message": "Consolidate duplicate code."}, {"date": "2012-11-18T17:06:38Z", "message": "Formatting."}, {"date": "2012-11-18T17:01:00Z", "message": "Needlessly optimize intersection code."}, {"date": "2012-11-18T16:46:43Z", "message": "Fix typo."}, {"date": "2012-11-18T16:40:57Z", "message": "Collection centroids are undefined.\n\nIt's not always meaningful to define the centroid of a collection because\ncollections are heterogenous: they can contain points, lines, polygons, or all\nthese types together.
