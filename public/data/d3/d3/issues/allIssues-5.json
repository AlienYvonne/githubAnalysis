Padding also would not apply to group nodes, only to the leaf nodes they contain.\n\nWith this change, it is possible to specify padding on any node, even group nodes. This value is added to the outer radius of the node when packing the nodes. This gives complete control over the spacing of any part of the layout. Since the computed padding is also exposed on the node via `node.p`, it is also possible to use the padding directly in the diagram. Padding is also computed on the first packing pass.\n### Related issues\n\nThis addresses #2247 and #1686 but differs from the solution proposed in #2379, which adds consideration for the `value` property on a group node. \n### Padding vs value\n\nThe `value` of a node in pack layouts is treated as the relative _area_ of a node. The `padding` of a node is added directly to the resulting _radius_ of a node.\n### Demos\n\n[Demo](http://bl.ocks.org/hughes/aeee6c44713598563393)\n\n[Demo 2](http://bl.ocks.org/hughes/9a5a68c0d49e02803e06)\n### Tests\n\nThis change affected all pack layout tests, as the computed padding is added to the projection of the test results, which is zero in all previously built tests. Six additional tests have been added to ensure expected behaviour of padding constants and functions.\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2464", "repository_url":

Most of D3 can get away with leaving exceptions to blast their way through, and I think that's a good design. Here, however, seems to be a slippery slope of needing to catch and delayed-throw any possible error to keep the mechanism on track.\n\nThe timer/transition logic can get in a really bad state depending on where the exception is thrown. If an exception hits `d3.timer` it simply breaks permanently, no more timers fire whether existing or registered later. Fixing that reveals a worse situation though: the transition logic monkey patches its own (internal to `d3.timer`!) callback, and usually only _after_ it has called its own callbacks [tweens, factories, event handlers\u2026] \u2014\u00a0so the internal transition logic stops advancing properly if _it_ doesn't handle exceptions, but it keeps getting triggered triggered triggered triggered forever anyway now that d3.timer does.\n\nPart of me still wants to fix this (thus this start), but I'd like some feedback first on what the best direction is:\n- give up and say timer/tween callbacks must not ever throw. _drawback:_ if any one caller breaks that rule, all others suffer.\n- have d3.timer catch but also automatically cancel any of its callbacks that throw. _drawback:_ means transition does not complete, probably leaving its selection/elements corrupted still.\n- wrap every single call of d3_transitionNode to any external tween/factory/event(/etc.?) handler with its own try/catch wart\n- overhaul d3_transitionNode to be more naturally robust, somehow.\n\nThoughts?\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2414", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2414/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2414/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2414/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/d3/d3/pull/2414", "id": 73105425, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzQ2NjYxMTQ=", "number": 2414, "title": "Pass group index (\"j\") to custom tween functions", "user": {"login": "natevw", "id": 265902, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTkwMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/265902?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/natevw", "html_url": "https://github.com/natevw", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/natevw/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/natevw/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/natevw/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/natevw/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/natevw/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/natevw/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/natevw/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/natevw/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/natevw/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/milestones/20", "html_url": "https://github.com/d3/d3/milestone/20", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/milestones/20/labels", "id": 233748, "node_id": "MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMjMzNzQ4", "number": 20, "title": "4.0", "description": "", "creator": {"login": "mbostock", "id": 230541, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mbostock", "html_url": "https://github.com/mbostock", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 113, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2012-12-21T18:31:37Z", "updated_at": "2016-07-14T19:35:21Z", "due_on": null, "closed_at": "2016-07-14T19:22:14Z"}, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2015-05-04T19:22:51Z", "updated_at": "2016-04-26T23:20:45Z", "closed_at": "2016-04-26T23:20:45Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/pulls/2414", "html_url": "https://github.com/d3/d3/pull/2414", "diff_url": "https://github.com/d3/d3/pull/2414.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/d3/d3/pull/2414.patch"}, "body": "Note that this is only a partial fix for #2413 \u2014\u00a0the other part may be \"unfixable\".

on some of their platforms).\n## Miscellaneous notes\n- Unfortunately, this required an (albeit minor and backwards compatible) addition to d3.mouse. My [original go at this](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/commit/736cc499739373d861d625affbf87991a36736f5) compared the ids itself, which seemed a better encapsulation, but the current drag code now already expects a missing (i.e. falsy) position return value as d3.touch gives so I've followed suit here. May actually be useful to other PE-aware users of d3.mouse I suppose.\n- I've made the touch-action setting a bit more careful in this go-'round. I again debated whether or not d3 should be setting a style property like this, but a) it's already doing much crazier DOM hacks when needed for other event handling, b) better to have it work by default for the 99% of cases and have anyone who really has some way for touch-action to remain 'auto' and still get useful work out of d3.drag (they can set back themselves).\n- Finally, as a more general comment, I haven't updated d3.zoom to work with PE. In my opinion, that behavior should be leveraging the work in d3.drag (+ one further trivial modification to also pass along the dragId with its events) to track touches in a cross-platform way but that needs a bit further discussion beyond https://github.com/mbostock/d3/issues/1793#issuecomment-38082270 \u2014 I have long been using `d3.drag` to track touches on a _parent_ element (rather than an actually dragged element) and it works fine by simply adjusting via `.origin()`.\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2397", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2397/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2397/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2397/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/d3/d3/pull/2397", "id": 69243444, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzM1OTE5NTI=", "number": 2397, "title": "added proposed tickFormat issue fix", "user": {"login": "MrCox", "id": 2783656, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODM2NTY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2783656?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrCox", "html_url": "https://github.com/MrCox", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrCox/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrCox/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrCox/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrCox/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrCox/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrCox/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrCox/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrCox/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MrCox/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2015-04-18T00:03:11Z", "updated_at": "2015-10-21T18:34:02Z", "closed_at": "2015-10-21T18:33:31Z", "author_association": "NONE", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/pulls/2397", "html_url": "https://github.com/d3/d3/pull/2397", "diff_url": "https://github.com/d3/d3/pull/2397.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/d3/d3/pull/2397.patch"}, "body": "I tried to modify the \"text-anchor\" style for ticks using the `tickFormat` method on d3 axes.
