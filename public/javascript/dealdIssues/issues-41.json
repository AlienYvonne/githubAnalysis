[11.1](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/24dc126e4b11bb60d053fc6c93598488b9bf0455#11.1).\n\nI bet you know _[trine](https://github.com/jussi-kalliokoski/trine)_. The whole concept of the lib is based on iterators \u2013 to have a unified set of functions working with any sort of collection. It looks very elegant and \u201cnative\u201d to JS:\n\n``` js\nconst characters = strings\n    ::map(String.prototype.split::partial(\"\"))\n    ::reduce(Array.prototype.concat)\n    .sort()\n    ::uniq();\n```\n\n:+1: Using iterators this way doesn\u2019t involve managing state, except when writing the utilies.\n\n:+1: There\u2019s no risk of mutating stuff. Every function is returns a new iterator.\n\n:+1: One more bonus \u2013 the thing is lazy. So you can map over infinite collections, etc. Lots of functional programming goodness.\n\n:-1: There\u2019s one \u201cbut\u201d. Working with iterators in such an elegant way is only possible with the [function bind syntax](https://github.com/zenparsing/es-function-bind). And that doesn\u2019t come into the spec until ES 2016 (if at all). They do transpile cleanly to ES5 with babel though.\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/503", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/503/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/503/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/503/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/503", "id": 105748537, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUxMDU3NDg1Mzc=", "number": 503, "title": "Blank lines between definitions in a class?", "user": {"login": "jacobp100", "id": 7275322, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzUzMjI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7275322?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jacobp100", "html_url": "https://github.com/jacobp100", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jacobp100/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jacobp100/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jacobp100/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jacobp100/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jacobp100/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jacobp100/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jacobp100/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jacobp100/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jacobp100/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2015-09-10T07:34:46Z", "updated_at": "2015-09-10T11:51:02Z", "closed_at": "2015-09-10T11:51:02Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "``` js\nclass Foo {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n  }\n  bar() {\n    return 'baz';\n  }\n}\n```\n\nShould there be a blank line between the end of `constructor` and `bar`?\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/501", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/501/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/501/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/501/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/501", "id": 105616107, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUxMDU2MTYxMDc=", "number": 501, "title": "Filenames with different UpperCamelCase are unsafe in case-insensitive filesystems", "user": {"login": "joaojeronimo", "id": 622337, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjMzNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/622337?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/joaojeronimo", "html_url": "https://github.com/joaojeronimo", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joaojeronimo/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joaojeronimo/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joaojeronimo/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joaojeronimo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joaojeronimo/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joaojeronimo/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joaojeronimo/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joaojeronimo/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joaojeronimo/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 11, "created_at": "2015-09-09T15:03:36Z", "updated_at": "2018-06-05T16:26:18Z", "closed_at": "2015-12-11T22:47:32Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "Using upper-camel-case for filenames, or any sort of case that involves different letter casing, is dangerous when your team includes developers committing code from case insensitive filesystems (mostly people with windows and NTFS, and OSX and case insensitive HFS+).\n\nIt's a problem specifically when a developer in a case insensitive filesystem renames a folder in a way that just changes the folder's case, and pushes it. Because github (and probably all git hosts) run on linux, you'll get an inconsistency there that you will not observe in an inconsistent file system.\n\nFor instance if you had `Button/Button.jsx` and `Button/style.css`, and you rename the button folder and file to `button/button.jsx`, in the remote git repository you would end up with two folders, `button/button.jsx` and `Button/style.css`. Nothing would be different in your local filesystem.\n\nI understand if you strictly follow the conventions and never ever change a folder case you will be fine, but it's easy to overlook if someone does it.\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/498", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/498/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/498/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/498/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/498", "id": 105156516, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUxMDUxNTY1MTY=", "number": 498, "title": "List SuperJobs as using the Styleguide", "user": {"login": "Weblors", "id": 8054624, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjgwNTQ2MjQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8054624?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Weblors", "html_url": "https://github.com/Weblors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Weblors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Weblors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Weblors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Weblors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Weblors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Weblors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Weblors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Weblors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Weblors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2015-09-07T06:41:02Z", "updated_at": "2015-09-09T06:17:13Z", "closed_at": "2015-09-09T06:17:13Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "Hey guys,\n\nJust wanted to let you know that we're using yor awesome styleguide as well.
