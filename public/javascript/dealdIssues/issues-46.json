Using `$(this)` in ES5 is quite popular to access the DOM element of the event handler. In ES6 the code breaks if you switch from function to arrow function syntax:\n\n``` js\n// works:\n$selector.on('click', function() {\n   $(this).hide();\n});\n\n// doesn't work:\n$selector.on('click', () => $(this).hide());\n```\n\nInstead you have to access the DOM element via `event.currentTarget`:\n\n``` js\n// works:\n$selector.on('click', ev => $(ev.currentTarget).hide());\n```\n\nIMO the main problem is that you can accidentally break code by just switching from `function` syntax to arrow functions.

The advice to not use generators hinges on the inability to transpile well to ES5, which I totally agree with. However, in certain JS environments (namely Node.js/io.js), generators are supported, and I believe their use should only be advised against in situations where the code will be transpiled to ES5.\n\nThus, I think we should amend the lines appropriately to indicate that:\n1. Generators can be used in situations where the code will not need to be transpiled\n2. Iterators can be used in certain situations\n   - Because, for instance, `for-of` loops combined with yielding inside a generator is a very useful technique, whereas `.forEach` loops combined with yielding inside a generator is not appropriate\n3. Generators should follow some certain style. It would seem based on [3] that the style should be\n   \n   ``` javascript\n   function* foobar() {...}\n   ```\n\nI believe we should keep the information that is currently there in tact and simply add these rules as a note or special case or something. It is certainly a good idea, for instance, to prefer using array-prototype-given looping mechanisms instead of `for-of`/iterator loops in order to avoid unnecessary mutation (as is currently suggested in [1]).\n\n[1] https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#11.1\n[2] https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#11.2\n[3] https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/240\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/368", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/368/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/368/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/368/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/368", "id": 90311276, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU5MDMxMTI3Ng==", "number": 368, "title": "3.4 having syntax error?", "user": {"login": "HenryGau", "id": 2501630, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE2MzA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2501630?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/HenryGau", "html_url": "https://github.com/HenryGau", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/HenryGau/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/HenryGau/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/HenryGau/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/HenryGau/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/HenryGau/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/HenryGau/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/HenryGau/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/HenryGau/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/HenryGau/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2015-06-23T07:22:16Z", "updated_at": "2015-06-23T07:36:34Z", "closed_at": "2015-06-23T07:36:19Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "Please have a check, I think 3.4 is having syntax error right?\nhttps://github.com/airbnb/javascript#3.4\n\n```\n  function getKey(k) {\n    return `a key named ${k}`;\n  }\n\n  // good\n  const obj = {\n    id: 5,\n    name: 'San Francisco',\n    [getKey('enabled')]: true,\n  };\n```\n\nis giving\nUncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token [\n    at Object.InjectedScript._evaluateOn (<anonymous>:895:140)\n    at Object.InjectedScript._evaluateAndWrap (<anonymous>:828:34)\n    at Object.InjectedScript.evaluate (<anonymous>:694:21)\non Chrome\n\nI think \n\n```\n    [getKey('enabled')]: true,\n```\n\nis not valid.\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/366", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/366/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/366/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/366/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/366", "id": 89385622, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU4OTM4NTYyMg==", "number": 366, "title": "eslint shareable configs / split", "user": {"login": "orlin", "id": 2434, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2434?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/orlin", "html_url": "https://github.com/orlin", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orlin/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orlin/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orlin/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orlin/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orlin/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orlin/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orlin/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orlin/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orlin/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 25, "created_at": "2015-06-18T20:09:48Z", "updated_at": "2015-09-30T18:28:22Z", "closed_at": "2015-09-27T19:30:21Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "Because the react plugin / jsx rules aren't optional with this style-guide, I found out there is an _official_ way for [sharing eslint configs](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs).
