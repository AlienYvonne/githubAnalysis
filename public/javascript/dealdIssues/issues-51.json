"body": "First of all, great job on this guide, I agree with it almost 100%. All of this should really be common knowledge, but I sure as hell didn't know most of these things when I started, so kudos for writing it all down.\n\nNow, since promises have been standardized and a lot of people have started using them, it would be nice to have a section on how to keep promise-based code readable. For instance, when chaining multiple promises together, there are at least two alternative ways to do it:\n#### Option 1: anonymous functions\n\n``` javascript\nreturn doSomething(foo).then(function(result) {\n  // ...\n}).then(function(result2) {\n  // ...\n}).then(function(result3) {\n  // ...\n}).catch(function(error) {\n  // ...\n}).finally(function() {\n  // ...\n});\n```\n#### Option 2: named functions\n\n``` javascript\nfunction doThis(result) {\n  // ...\n}\nfunction doThat(result) {\n  // ...\n}\nfunction handleError(error) {\n  // ...\n}\nfunction done() {\n  // ...\n}\n\nreturn doSomething(foo)\n  .then(doThis)\n  .then(doThat)\n  .catch(handleError)\n  .finally(done);\n```\n\nThe second way, while being somewhat more verbose, seems to be preferable, as the chain of tasks that the promise result travels through becomes more obvious. \n\nI did an internal poll of our developers, and so far, option 2 seems to be ahead, although I have not heard from everyone yet. How does AirBnB deal with this, and what are your opinions?\n"}]
