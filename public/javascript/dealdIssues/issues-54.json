If you really need a private variable why not create an object and wrap your variable with setters and getters.  If you use _ and someone thinks they need that variable or method they will use it.  I have seen it before lots of times.  Conventions work when you are doing ruby and rails type implementation and the conventions are required for things to work right, but when conventions are guidlines there is no stopping people from behaving badly.  Also this conflicts with the _this, which someone could easily do this._this.  \n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/136", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/136/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/136/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/136/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/136", "id": 25080555, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUyNTA4MDU1NQ==", "number": 136, "title": "Unclear code example in variables section", "user": {"login": "Daniel-Hug", "id": 1326984, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjY5ODQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1326984?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Hug", "html_url": "https://github.com/Daniel-Hug", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Hug/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Hug/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Hug/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Hug/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Hug/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Hug/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Hug/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Hug/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Hug/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 9, "created_at": "2014-01-06T00:03:12Z", "updated_at": "2015-04-02T06:00:16Z", "closed_at": "2015-04-02T06:00:16Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "At the bottom of the [variables section](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#variables), this code example is given:\n\n```\n// bad\nfunction() {\n  var name = getName();\n\n  if (!arguments.length) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  return true;\n}\n\n// good\nfunction() {\n  if (!arguments.length) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  var name = getName();\n\n  return true;\n}\n```\n\nAt the top of that code block it says:\n\n> Assign variables at the top of their scope.
