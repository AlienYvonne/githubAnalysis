The developer may not always control the initial state of a variable if it's loaded from an API, so using explicit checks against empty strings is likely to result in subtle bugs in your code. To truly be safe, you'd have to do `if (name !== undefined && name !== null && name !== '') {`, which is pretty terrible.\r\n\r\nFor most things, you only care about \"do I have a value\".

But they can make code easier to understand if they are wielded properly. Instead of banning nested ternaries, require that they are formatted such that **each line has a single condition and a single result**, with the catch-all at the end:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// bad\r\nconst foo = maybe1 > maybe2\r\n  ? \"bar\"\r\n  : value1 > value2 ? \"baz\" : null;\r\n\r\n// good\r\nconst foo =\r\n  maybe1 > maybe2 ? \"bar\"\r\n  : value1 > value2 ? \"baz\"\r\n  : null;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is similar to a switch statement that always `break`s. With this pattern, it's impossible to get lost in nested contexts. Once you've ruled out a line applying to the case you're considering, you can safely forget it. It's easier to understand than the solutions provided by the style guide right now, and also saves a memory allocation.\r\n\r\nHere are some other examples where this pattern improves code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// bad\r\nlet result;\r\nif (operator === \u2018+\u2019) {\r\n  result = left + right;\r\n} else if (operator === \u2018*\u2019) {\r\n  result = left * right;\r\n} else if
