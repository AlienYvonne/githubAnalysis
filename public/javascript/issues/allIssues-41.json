I wanted to propose a collaboration between this repo and https://github.com/walmartlabs/eslint-config-defaults.\n\nI originally set out to build config-defaults because I was tired of copy pasting my eslint config around and trying to keep them up to date across lots of projects. Eslint's `extends` key fixes the distribution problem but there are still two issues:\n1. Managing the eslint config file is a pain in the ass even though it is centralized. New rules are added, removed, moved and deprecated all the time!\n2. Just get up and running for a new project was not straightforward and I strongly believe that code quality tooling should be well suited to those who are just starting out. They're often the ones who need it most after all.\n\n---\n\nIt's obvious that you all saw the same problems and it has been enormously helpful to a lot of people. and we've already worked together in #366 and #526 but I want to take your config one step further and I am asking for your help. With eslint-config-defaults I want to try to centralize the config from a few thought leaders around the web so that folks have fast, standard and up to date options from the start.\n\nI've been maintaining an \"unofficial\" airbnb config for a while now but it's duplicate effort and my hope is to try to collaborate/consolidate. For my part, I am committed to staying on top of the latest rules (and deprecations). I should mention that you all have quite a few missing rules already :).\n\nPotential Objections(?):\n- **We need quick access to the repo to make changes.** - I'm happy to try to get your maintainers added to the project.\n- **The project is under walmartlabs and I'm not too sure I like that.** - It's possible we could spin this out into it's own org - I'd have to talk to legal and such about what we can do.\n- **We don't want to install all the configs!** - Maybe we can do what babel does and have multiple npm packages under the same project. We can figure that out.\n- **This project is really popular and is an exceptional part of our OSS portfolio that we're not going to shut down.** - You could easily take config-defaults as a dependency and keep this exactly how it is. Really, this repo's strength is it's plain english documentation and is kindof an awkward place to store ESLint rules.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to start a conversation and see if we can make it work for both of us.\n\n@justjake @taion @ljharb @hshoff\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/637", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/637/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/637/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/637/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/637", "id": 123669844, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTQ0NzQ4NDY=", "number": 637, "title": "Move strict mode from legacy include to index include", "user": {"login": "evenfrost", "id": 3055750, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTU3NTA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3055750?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/evenfrost", "html_url": "https://github.com/evenfrost", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evenfrost/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evenfrost/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evenfrost/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evenfrost/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evenfrost/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evenfrost/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evenfrost/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evenfrost/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evenfrost/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2015-12-23T14:37:44Z", "updated_at": "2016-01-15T16:45:45Z", "closed_at": "2015-12-24T16:35:26Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/pulls/637", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/637", "diff_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/637.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/637.patch"}, "body": "Permit strict mode for legacy configuration as this mode is not intended to be used with Babel.\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/636", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/636/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/636/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/636/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/636", "id": 123610312, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTQ0NDQwMjA=", "number": 636, "title": "React readme cleanup", "user": {"login": "lencioni", "id": 195534, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTUzNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/195534?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/lencioni", "html_url": "https://github.com/lencioni", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lencioni/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lencioni/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lencioni/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lencioni/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lencioni/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lencioni/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lencioni/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lencioni/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lencioni/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 311904405, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwzMTE5MDQ0MDU=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/labels/editorial", "name": "editorial", "color": "bfe5bf", "default": false}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2015-12-23T06:48:41Z", "updated_at": "2016-01-15T16:46:06Z", "closed_at": "2015-12-23T19:44:40Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/pulls/636", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/636", "diff_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/636.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/636.patch"}, "body": "While I was poking around in this file today, I noticed a few very minor things that could use some attention.
