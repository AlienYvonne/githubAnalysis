"author_association": "NONE", "body": "Hi there\n\nAs your styleguide is getting popular I just wanted to express some concerns I have with it. I'm generally for styleguides, however, I believe that things are always depending on a context and if you're classifying something as bad / good you should always include a \"why\" and reason about your decision. There is nothing more frustrating than seeing developers which were trained to accept a fact that something is good or bad but they don't know the reasoning behind. Things can change from one day to the other and they will have no background to re-validate their decisions.\n\nFrom an educational standpoint but also for future maintenance of your styleguide (as things are changing and you need to adopt) I strongly recommend you to include short reasoning in your examples why something is considered good or bad at that given time and context. One example would be in your type coercion entries. Why is it bad to use the unary + operator to convert a string to a number? In some context this makes absolute sense (both float and int can be converted, hex and exponent strings can be converted) and also it's faster than parseInt / parseFloat. If you include the \"why\" in your comments you can clarify your assumptions and the context.\n\nThere are also plenty of recommendations that are based on pure preference. Although, I prefer single quote over double quote string notation, and I have my personal functional explanation why I prefer them, there is no general explanation why they should be preferred. This is simply personal preference with some vague functional reasoning. I can imagine a lot of young developers following your styleguide will think that there is something wrong with double quotes and they will probably think JSON is ridiculously flawed and the jQuery source code (they prefer double quotes) is a pile of crap... I'd really also put a reasoning behind it and also explain that it's not necessarily a bad thing, whats really bad is not being consistent.\n\nThanks and I hope you agree to my motivation.\n\nCheers\nGion\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/268", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/268/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/268/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/268/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/268", "id": 65317720, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzIyNzQyMTc=", "number": 268, "title": "Resolves issue #136", "user": {"login": "jakeoverall", "id": 7350663, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjczNTA2NjM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7350663?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jakeoverall", "html_url": "https://github.com/jakeoverall", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jakeoverall/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jakeoverall/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jakeoverall/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jakeoverall/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jakeoverall/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jakeoverall/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jakeoverall/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jakeoverall/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jakeoverall/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2015-03-30T22:29:09Z", "updated_at": "2015-03-30T23:32:14Z", "closed_at": "2015-03-30T23:32:14Z", "author_association": "NONE", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/pulls/268", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/268", "diff_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/268.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/268.patch"}, "body": "Unclear code example in variables section.

recommended to use one var declaration per variable: \n\n``` javascript\n// bad\nvar items = getItems(),\n    goSportsTeam = true,\n    dragonball = 'z';\n\n// bad\n// (compare to above, and try to spot the mistake)\nvar items = getItems(),\n    goSportsTeam = true;\n    dragonball = 'z';\n\n// good\nvar items = getItems();\nvar goSportsTeam = true;\nvar dragonball = 'z';\n```\n\nHowever, IMHO, I think that the first one is the best because it's more concise and also makes better performance. What do you think?\n"}]
