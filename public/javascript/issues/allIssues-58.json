Should this still be wrapped in an anonymous function?\n\nIf I'm injecting html/style/script tags, do they always get appended to the end of the head or body? Is prefixing every id/class with \"myLibrary_varName\" enough to avoid collisions?\n\nWhen is it ok to use iframes, document.write, etc.?\n\nWhen injecting an overlay do I just set the z-index to \"2147483647\"? Once my content needs to go away, can I set it to \"display:none;\" or do I need to remove it from the DOM?\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/127", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/127/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/127/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/127/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/127", "id": 23829906, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTA1NzgwMDY=", "number": 127, "title": "Spaces Around Operators", "user": {"login": "iamnirav", "id": 313886, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzg4Ng==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/313886?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/iamnirav", "html_url": "https://github.com/iamnirav", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iamnirav/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iamnirav/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iamnirav/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iamnirav/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iamnirav/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iamnirav/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iamnirav/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iamnirav/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iamnirav/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2013-12-06T00:37:15Z", "updated_at": "2014-06-24T00:45:08Z", "closed_at": "2013-12-06T03:54:16Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/pulls/127", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/127", "diff_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/127.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/127.patch"}, "body": "This is the convention throughout the guide itself, but isn't specifically called out anywhere.\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/126", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/126/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/126/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/126/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/126", "id": 23773300, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTA1NDU2NTg=", "number": 126, "title": "32-bit integers and bitwise operators explained with example of issues", "user": {"login": "Jabher", "id": 1269512, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjk1MTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1269512?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jabher", "html_url": "https://github.com/Jabher", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jabher/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jabher/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jabher/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jabher/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jabher/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jabher/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jabher/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jabher/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jabher/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2013-12-05T08:42:07Z", "updated_at": "2014-06-15T04:58:28Z", "closed_at": "2014-06-07T01:08:34Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/pulls/126", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/126", "diff_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/126.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/126.patch"}, "body": "I've added this example to russian translation when I've got question from one of our juniors \"what's the limits of wise use of bitwise operators\".
