Well it is not stupid in the context where you want to support IE8, but to sacrifice code quality because of inferior JS interpreter is stupid. The code is not wrong, IE8 is wrong for having dumb JS compiler. You shouldn't say that it is \"good\" for people to make sacrifices to their code to support stupid software. The good thing is that MS fixes IE. At least you should note this and mark this guideline as transient. Further IE8 is old even by today's standards and claiming such practice as good where nobody will need to consider IE8 very soon (or IMO nobody need to consider IE9 already but this is off topic) is not good.\n\nBTW the Rhino JS engine is also dumb regarding property names so using such names causes problems with YUI compressor.

All numbers are equally true, they are just numbers. The logical negation operator converts from numbers to bools but this is just a dumb legacy from C where there are no real bools and convenience but has nothing to do with good practice. And further - double negation a good practice - are you serious? This damages readability so much, it could really confuse young people making them wonder if this is some kind of new operator and even experienced developers will need to think about what it does. And if you are debugging and you are in some kind of confusion already this will only add to the confusion. Then you need to be aware of all language specifics like what negation does to strings, empty strings, arrays, empty arrays, objects, empty objects, bools, numbers, specific numbers. If it was strongly typed language like C it is better because you know the type of \"age\", but in JS, and particularly in debugging/undocumented/confused situation you don't know the type of age and the code will produce different results.\n\nThe right thing to do would be.\n\n```\n// bad.. just think about it - what does \"not age\" even means?\n// further the intention is not clear\nif ( !age ) {}\n\n// good, the intention is perfectly clear\n// further the code will work even with wrong types\nif ( age > 0 ) {}\nif ( age !== 0 ) {}\n\n// good\nvar hasAge = (age > 0);\n```\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/96", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/96/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/96/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/96/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/96", "id": 22307744, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUyMjMwNzc0NA==", "number": 96, "title": "Optimization and consistency for the string example", "user": {"login": "ghost", "id": 10137, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ghost", "html_url": "https://github.com/ghost", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2013-11-08T00:39:44Z", "updated_at": "2015-04-02T06:06:26Z", "closed_at": "2015-04-02T06:06:26Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "Your \"good\" string example. Could be optimized.\nFirst of all you are using `items[i] = ...` and in another example you point this is \"bad\" and say the \"good\" is to use `items.push()`. Then since you already know the size of the array you could pre-allocate with `items = new Array( length );`. Although I must point that this may actually degrade performance in some cases where JS engines are optimized for \"bad\" practices and when you do the right thing you may actually break the optimization.\n\n```\n// good\nfunction inbox(messages) {\n  items = [];\n\n  for (i = 0; i < length; i++) {\n    items[i] = messages[i].message;\n  }\n\n  return '<ul><li>' + items.join('</li><li>') + '</li></ul>';\n}\n```\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/95", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/95/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/95/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/95/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/95", "id": 22301157, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0OTc3Njc0OA==", "number": 95, "title": "Format object array to conform to whitespace guidelines", "user": {"login": "lxe", "id": 1486609, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODY2MDk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1486609?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/lxe", "html_url": "https://github.com/lxe", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lxe/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lxe/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lxe/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lxe/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lxe/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lxe/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lxe/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lxe/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lxe/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2013-11-07T22:25:23Z", "updated_at": "2014-06-23T02:56:07Z", "closed_at": "2013-12-27T02:31:36Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/pulls/95", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/95", "diff_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/95.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/95.patch"}, "body": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#whitespace \n\n>  Place 1 space before the leading brace.\n\nI believe it applies here.
