bench](http://jsperf.com/array-direct-assignment-vs-push/10), which has much cleaner code, seems to remove this difference, and even show `push` as faster in recent Chrome versions (which I would have spontaneously thought, considering the JIT optimizations that can be done on predictable function calls rather than guessing numerical access).\n\nAre you sure that this recommendation is still to be followed?\n\nAll the best,\nMatti\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/26", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript", "labels_url":
