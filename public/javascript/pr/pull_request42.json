This PR shows our code will be faster, easier to read, and easier to write by adopting a more modern wider max column length.\n## Why 80 columns?\n\nFirst, where did this standard come from and why was it used?\n#### Punchcards\n\nYes, columns of 80 characters were instituted for IBM [punch cards](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/148677/why-is-80-characters-the-standard-limit-for-code-width).  Somewhat arbitrarily as because they were wanted to reuse currency carriers [from 1890](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/148677/why-is-80-characters-the-standard-limit-for-code-width/148678#comment-281684).\n#### Old Tech\n\nTypewriters, early text editors, and early terminals also used this _traditional_ width as seen [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_per_line).  All modern text editors and terminals now support variable column widths (and softwrap if you prefer).  Even so, the StackOverflow 2015 survey [shows ~82%](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#tech-editor) of developers do not use a terminal as their text editor.\n\n> Side note, JS is the [most popular](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#tech-lang) tech :D Woooo!\n#### Readability\n\nIt is widely regarded that columns ~40-66-ish are most readable.  So, \"narrower columns are more readable than wider columns\". Science has shown this to be false.  On screen columns narrower than 95cpl actually decrease reading [speed and comprehension](http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/usabilitynews/72/pdf/Usability%20News%2072%20-%20Shaikh.pdf).  Summary [here](http://viget.com/inspire/the-line-length-misconception).\n## Why _not_ 80 columns\n\nHere are some pragmatic reasons why we should _not_ be using this antiquated arbitrary standard.\n### Code Performance\n#### Variables & Closures\n\nIn order to fit code into narrower columns, variables that would _not otherwise be initialized_ are often initialized just to break down column count.  This is unjustified as it is not for readability, performance, or organization.\n\nDeclaring and initializing variables costs cycles and memory.  More importantly, it encourages [closure abuse](https://developers.google.com/speed/articles/optimizing-javascript#avoiding-pitfalls-with-closures) because the developer is likely to move code in a nested location up to an outer closure to gain the extra indentation, allowing it to fit on a single line.\n#### Concatenating strings\n\nStrings are often forced to be concatenated when arbitrarily limiting column width.  This causes extra code, extra operations, and decreased readability.  Concatenating strings is a known [performance issue](https://developers.google.com/speed/articles/optimizing-javascript#working-with-strings).  Using a `[].join('')` is faster but also unnecessarily slow and verbose when the entire issue can be circumvented by allowing a string to be defined in a single line.\n### Developer Performance\n#### Problem Solving Energy\n\nThe developer is no longer just thinking \"how do I write elegant code?\" but also now adds the constraint \"how I do refactor my elegant code to fit inside 80 columns?\"  These are extra brain cycles that could be put toward solving application engineering problems instead of arbitrarily fitting their code into 80 columns.\n#### Code Reasoning\n\nBreaking code down into such small segments can turn an easily turn a readable 2/3 LOC into a very contrived set of variables and string concatenations that is difficult to parse.  In my experience, this outcome is more common than an improved outcome when limiting lines to 80 columns.\n\nIt is also harder to retain your train of thought about the system when you have to stop and reason about the superfluous variables and concatenation for an individual method before moving on.\n#### Comprehension\n\nThe developer regularly has to ask \"what words can I cut out of this to make it fit\".  The result is often a hasty move to hack and slash a less helpful error message, a more cryptic method name, further abbreviated variables, etc.\n#### Diversion\n\nReally stop and think about how many times a day you fiddle with a line, 2, 3, 4 times trying various refactors because you are 1-4 characters over the limit.  These changes were not prompted to improve user experience, developer efficiency, nor system performance but to meet an arbitrary goal with no tangible benefits.  Seems tiny, but this stuff adds up.  Like how recaptcha accidentally wasted a [>a quarter billion](http://www.cnet.com/news/recaptcha-reusing-your-wasted-time-online/) hours of human energy a year.\n## Why 120 columns?\n\nBreaking things down can be good.  Breaking them down too much can be bad.  The PR suggests 120 columns (another arbitrary standard) still requires the developer to break down code, but with far less negative impact to code performance, developer performance, and readability.\n# Conclusion\n\nThe 'standard' 80 column width is arbitrary and antiquated.  There is no measurable gain to the user, the developer, nor the system by limiting columns.  Further, it is shown above that this limit actually decrease code performance, developer performance, and readability.  A wider arbitrary limit reduces these negative impacts while maintaining the sometimes helpful rule to break code down.\n\n:facepunch:\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/457", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/457/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/457/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/457/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/457", "id": 99480319, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDE4MTAwNTg=", "number": 457, "title": "Add missing `state`", "user": {"login": "naistran", "id": 1214699, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQ2OTk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1214699?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/naistran", "html_url": "https://github.com/naistran", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naistran/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naistran/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naistran/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naistran/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naistran/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naistran/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naistran/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naistran/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naistran/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2015-08-06T16:56:43Z", "updated_at": "2015-08-06T19:54:03Z", "closed_at": "2015-08-06T19:54:03Z", "author_association": "NONE", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/pulls/457", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/457", "diff_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/457.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/457.patch"}, "body": "There's `defaultProps` but there's no `state` for React.\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/455", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/455/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/455/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/455/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/455", "id": 99260294, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDE3MDU5MjM=", "number": 455, "title": "Mention eslint-config-airbnb", "user": {"login": "architectcodes", "id": 4624660, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjQ2NjA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4624660?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/architectcodes", "html_url": "https://github.com/architectcodes", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/architectcodes/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/architectcodes/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/architectcodes/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/architectcodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/architectcodes/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/architectcodes/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/architectcodes/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/architectcodes/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/architectcodes/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 11, "created_at": "2015-08-05T17:45:16Z", "updated_at": "2015-10-28T21:14:13Z", "closed_at": "2015-08-05T18:49:54Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/pulls/455", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/455", "diff_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/455.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/455.patch"}, "body": "Actually, if we want to make the thing more convenient, we could go as far as saying:\n\n``````\nBefore using our `.eslintrc` install these dependencies:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save-dev eslint-config-airbnb eslint babel-eslint eslint-plugin-react\n```\n``````\n\nI want to leave the decision up to you though.\n"}]
