Read the ES6 style guide in full [here](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6).\n### Introduction\n\nWelcome to the future. This PR updates our style guide to reflect the current style for writing ES6 at Airbnb. As before, this is a living document and it'll change over time as we and the community learn. Of course, this isn't the \"one true way to write ES6\" and doesn't intend to be\u2014just one _mostly_ reasonable approach.\n\nWe think having a style guide is important for readability of code and scalability of engineering teams. Our philosophy is that you shouldn't be able to tell who wrote a file based on the style of the code.\n\nAs always, please fork this guide and use it as a starting point for your own style guide, and if you hit on a problem or something you'd like to share, we welcome [Issues](/airbnb/javascript/issues/new) and [Pull Requests](/airbnb/javascript/compare)\u2014we love having discussions about this stuff.\n### What's New\n\nWe've updated existing sections to reflect ES6 best practices (i.e., `var` -> `const`) and added guides for the following language features:\n- [Arrow Functions](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#arrow-functions)\n- [Classes](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#constructors)\n- [Object Shorthand](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#es6-object-shorthand)\n- [Object Concise](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#es6-object-concise)\n- [Object Computed Properties](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#es6-computed-properties)\n- [Template Strings](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#es6-template-literals)\n- [Destructuring](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#destructuring)\n- [Default Parameters](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#es6-default-parameters)\n- [Rest](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#es6-rest)\n- [Array Spreads](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#es6-array-spreads)\n- [Let and Const](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#references)\n- [Iterators and Generators](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#iterators-and-generators)\n- [Modules](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#modules)\n### ES5 Support\n\nWe'll continue to maintain the ES5 style guide at [`/es5/README.md`](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6/es5). We moved the ES5 style guide into its own folder because Airbnb is moving towards ES6, and since this public repo is the style guide we use internally, we'd like it to reflect our current best practices.  We'll also be adding additional style guides that we use internally, like our in-progress React+JSX style guide.\n### Learn ES6\n\nSome resources we've found helpful in learning ES6:\n- [ECMAScript Language Specification Draft](https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html)\n- [ES6 Features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features)\n- [Exploring JS](http://exploringjs.com)\n- [ES6 Compatibility Table](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)\n### Compiling ES6\n\nIf you'd like to use ES6 syntax in a reasonable set of current browsers, you'll have to transpile your code to ES5. We recommend both [traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler) and [babel](http://babeljs.io) as activley-maintained, standards-compliant ES6 compilers. We use Babel internally.\n### FAQ\n\nWhat happened to the old guide?\n\n> It's still here! Have a look: [`/es5/README.md`](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6/es5)\n\nShould I be writing ES6?\n\n>  Up to you and your team! We're making the switch at Airbnb. Check out our ES5 style guide if you're not making the jump yet.\n\nWhy does JavaScript need a style guide?\n\n> A great question, see: [#102](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/102)\n### Next Steps\n\nThe plan is to merge this after a week or so of gathering feedback from the community. Have a look and let us know your thoughts.\n\n[Read the ES6 style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6)\n\nSpecial thanks go out to @iamnirav, @alvinsng, @hshoff, @justjake, and @spikebrehm for looking at a draft of this.\n\nFixes part of #247.\n\n:hamburger: :fries: \n"}]
