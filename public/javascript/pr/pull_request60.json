They're very readable -- more so than braced-single-statement blocks, in my opinion -- and I don't think they're \"dangerous\" in the Crockford sense, because if it's on a single line it's obvious what's part of the block and what isn't.\n\nFor example, I think it's pretty clear in the following that `console.log` will always be called:\n\n``` javascript\nvar volume = 10;\nif(louder) volume = 11;\nconsole.log(volume);\n```\n\nOn the other hand, I _do_ think that multi-line blocks without braces are dangerous. For example, this is very confusing:\n\n``` javascript\nvar volume = 10;\nif(louder)\n  volume = 12;\n  console.log(volume);\n```\n\nSo I left multi-line blocks as needing curly braces.\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/2", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/2/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/2/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/2/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/2", "id": 8046964, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mjg1NzM4MQ==", "number": 2, "title": "remove invalid interpolation examples", "user": {"login": "wyattdanger", "id": 72922, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcyOTIy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/72922?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/wyattdanger", "html_url": "https://github.com/wyattdanger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wyattdanger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wyattdanger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wyattdanger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wyattdanger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wyattdanger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wyattdanger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wyattdanger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wyattdanger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wyattdanger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2012-11-01T23:35:31Z", "updated_at": "2014-08-08T06:42:00Z", "closed_at": "2012-11-01T23:38:06Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/pulls/2", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/2", "diff_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/2.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/2.patch"}, "body": "ruby style interpolation does not work in javascript.\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/1", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/1/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/1/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/issues/1/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/1", "id": 8046913, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mjg1NzM1Mg==", "number": 1, "title": "Interpolation Docs Fix", "user": {"login": "wyattdanger", "id": 72922, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcyOTIy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/72922?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/wyattdanger", "html_url": "https://github.com/wyattdanger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wyattdanger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wyattdanger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wyattdanger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wyattdanger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wyattdanger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wyattdanger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wyattdanger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wyattdanger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wyattdanger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2012-11-01T23:32:03Z", "updated_at": "2012-11-01T23:33:33Z", "closed_at": "2012-11-01T23:33:33Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/javascript/pulls/1", "html_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/1", "diff_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/1.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/1.patch"}, "body": "Ruby-style interpolation does not work in JavaScript\n"}]
